# Pros and Cons of TDD


Pros:


1. When constructing unit tests, programmers are forced to think about all the possible scenarios (corner cases) for users when using the application, thus providing more insights on code implementation.
2. Seeking for constructing unit tests more quickly and easily, programmers would reflect on the code styling and structures and aim at writing code that is better organized and has a higher level of readablity.
3. Tests along development could help programmers to locate the bug as early as possible, preventing potential disasters that are hard to fix because of stacked bugs.
4. Unit tests could help programmers locate the bug in a relatively narrow position, reducing the difficulty of debugging.


Cons:


1. There are tons of different testing frameworks for backend and frontend (for example, there are jest, MochaJS, Karma, etc. for javascript alone) and it takes a long time for novices to learn about different testing frameworks
2. Learning new testing frameworks for light-weight projects causes large (sometimes unnecessary) overheads for the project
